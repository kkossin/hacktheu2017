PayWithYoFace is an iOS application that uses facial recognition to identify a user by name when given 1 or more photos of that user. The name is then linked to a Galileo Processing account so that a picture of the person can be used to request and authorize financial transactions.

The Galileo Processing API is used to create accounts that tie a prn to the user's facial model, carry out transactions between two users, and to view account balance and transaction history.

The Kairos API provides Machine Learning models for facial recognition. Once trained, the application can identify and report someone's name from a new photo.

Our objective is to provide a simple and straightforward payment solution that's fast and secure. We hope the application will be appreciated by all, especially those seeking a more convenient method of payment like small mobile business owners and frequent shoppers.
